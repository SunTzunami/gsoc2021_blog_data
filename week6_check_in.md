<h2>Fifth week of coding </h2>
<p>Welcome to the fifth weekly check-in. I'll be sharing my progress for the fifth week of coding.</p>
<h2> What did you do this week? </h2>
<p>
</p><ol><li>Generalised the vtkProteinRibbonFilter implementation.</li>
  <li>Updated the <a href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/452">molecular module</a> based on suggestions of team members and mentors.</li>
  <li>Updated wave function animation <a href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/362">PR</a>.<br>

</ol>
  <p></p>
<h2>What is coming up next week?</h2>
<p>
</p><ol><li>Update molecular module based on team members' suggestions and add tests for the same.</li>
  <li>Add protein ribbon implementation in the molecular.</li>
  <li>Begin working on molecular surface model.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<h2>Did you get stuck anywhere?</h2>
<p>Generalising the vtkProteinRibbonFilter implementation was something I had been stuck on since past few weeks. I'm grateful to the mentors for keeping a meeting and for helping me debug the code. I figured out most of the stuff courtesy the meeting.</p>
