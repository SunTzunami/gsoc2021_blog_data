<h2>Fourth week of coding </h2>
<p>Welcome to the fourth weekly check-in. I'll be sharing my progress for the fourth week of coding.</p>
<h2> What did you do this week? </h2>
<p>Created a <a href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/452">PR</a> for the molecular module. Enables the ability to create three types of 
molecular representations - 
<ol>
  <li>Space-filling model aka calotte model and CPK model.</li>
  <li>Stick model.</li>
  <li>Ball and Stick model.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h2>What is coming up next week?</h2>
<p>Mentors suggested changes to be made to the molecular module which I shall make. Other goals to be decided post mid-week meeting.</p>
<h2>Did you get stuck anywhere?</h2>
<p>Sending protein data to ProteinRibbonFilter via a polydata has been unsuccessful so far.</p>
