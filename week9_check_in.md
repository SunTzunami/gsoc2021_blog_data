<h2>Eighth week of coding </h2>
<p>Welcome to the ninth weekly check-in. I'll be sharing my progress for the eighth week of coding.</p>
<h2> What did you do this week? </h2>
<p><ol>
  <li>Added my GSoC blogs to the FURY blogs directory. (<a href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/475/files">PR #475</a>)</li>
  <li>Updated <a href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/452">PR #452</a>: Had an extra meeting with the mentors in which we fine-tuned the
   module (changed variable names, made it more pythonic) and optimised code.</li>
    <li>I was able to generate vertices and triangles for molecular surface model by using a bioconda package called <a href="https://anaconda.org/bioconda/msms">msms</a>. 
      It's based on <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/%28SICI%291097-0282%28199603%2938%3A3%3C305%3A%3AAID-BIP4%3E3.0.CO%3B2-Y">this</a> paper by
      Michel F. Sanner, Arthur J. Olson & Jean-Claude Spehner. It was then rendered via  </li></ol>
</p>
<h2>What is coming up next week?</h2>
<p>Work more upon molecular surface model. Create tutorials to explain molecular module. Rest of the goals will be decided in the meeting with mentors.</p>
<h2>Did you get stuck anywhere?</h2>
<p>No.</p>
