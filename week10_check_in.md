<h2>Ninth week of coding </h2>
<p>Welcome to the tenth weekly check-in. I'll be sharing my progress for the ninth week of coding.</p>
<h2> What did you do this week? </h2>
<p><ol>
  <li>Updated <a href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/452">PR #452</a>: <ul><li>Updated a part of code to make it faster (combined the work of two loops into one).</li>
    <li>Added an actor to display bounding box around the molecule.

  <li>Made a tutorial which showcases the abilities of molecular module (will create a PR after molecular module is merged).</li>
  </li>
<li>I was able to render SES via FURY by using MSMS binary.

  I'm trying to make a native implementation. Reading papers to understand how to go about it. 
  Seems kinda intimidating as I've never done math related to this domain (topology).</li></ol>
</p>
<h2>What is coming up next week?</h2>
<p><ol><li>Try to create a native implementation of molecular surface.</li>
  <li>Small fixes to <a href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/362">PR #362</a>, <a href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/462">PR #462</a>
  </li></ol></p>
<h2>Did you get stuck anywhere?</h2>
<p>No.</p>
