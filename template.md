<h2>Second week of coding </h2>
<p>Welcome to the second weekly check-in. I'll be sharing my progress for the second week of coding.</p>
<h2> What did you do this week? </h2>
<p> I created an example to demonstrate how one can render multiple bonds (double and triple). This required me to write an algorithm to detect bonding. I used <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/aekoch95/bonds-from-structure-data">this</a> as a reference and made a few tweaks of my own to detect double bond/triple bond from interatomic distance. The math involved in generating the coordinates of bonds was quite intriguing.

 In addition to this, I tried understanding the codebase of vtkMolecule and vtkMoleculeMapper and was able to visualize bond-stick models and stick models using it.
 This will be of great help although it's rather slow in rendering (using shaders to improve its speed will be crucial).
